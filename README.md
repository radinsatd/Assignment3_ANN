# Assignment3: Predicting Mapping Penalties with a From-Scratch ANN
This project features a fully self-contained feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) developed from scratch using NumPy. Its primary purpose is to predict the penalty score for assigning 10 tasks across 5 employees.

## Repository Overview
- `Data` folder &#8594; includes the input mapping dataset and the Python script used to generate these mappings
- `Results` folder &#8594; holds all comparison plots generated duing the model's execution in Google Colab
- `ANN_Notebook.ipynb` &#8594; the core ANN implementation

## Getting Started
To launch in Google Colab please click the following link:

**OPTIONAL - Local Setup**  
Ensure the following packages are installed:
`pip install numpy pandas matplotlib`

To run Assignment3_ANN_Notebook.ipynb in Google Colab go to Runtime &#8594; Run all.
